            <p class="drop-shadow">Good day, humans. I am an anthropomorphic Gooseman. I'm a student at Code Lousville, and
                that's quite an accomplishment since I don't have any fingers to code with. In about 24 weeks I will have the
                skills and
                knowledge to be hired as a Junior Web Developer. I'll just have to resist the urge to attack people without
                provocation at my new workplace. I make no promises.</p>

            <h2 class="drop-shadow">About the Gooseman</h2>

            <p class="drop-shadow">I like to fly around and attack people for no good reason. No matter how fast you
                run, I guarantee you I am faster. My favorite hunting grounds
                are local parks and small lakes. I usually find that that lakes just don't make enough noise, so I enjoy
                squawking
                endlessly while you're trying to have a relaxing lakeside picnic. Even if you give me bread, I still
                won't shut up, becaue I hate you.
                I tend to make my nests in inconvenient places, like your front porch, and then get angry when you get
                too close.
                Sure, it used to be your house, but now it's mine.
                Another favorite pastime is crossing the road VERY slowly. I know I have wings, but I never feel like
                using them,
                so you'll just need to slam on your brakes and deal with it. Oh, I also poop on things. A lot of things.
                JUST BECAUSE I CAN.</p>

                    the red bag she was carrying. Since I'm a goose, I don't have any money to buy my own
                    bags, so I decided to take hers.

                    So, I decided to teach this dude and his friends a lesson when they chose to play their dumb game
